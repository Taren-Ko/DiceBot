# DiceBot
A Discord bot written in Python that allows for complex dicerolls
## How to Install
Create a bot through [Discord's Developer Site](http://discordapp.com/developers), then insert your bot token into this code and run. You must have [discord.py](https://github.com/Rapptz/discord.py) and [Python 3.6](https://www.python.org/) installed on your machine.
## Dicerolls
To roll the dice, enter the command "<>roll" followed by your number of dice and the number of sides for the dice in the form 'int'd'int'

*Ex. If I want to roll 3 20-sided die, I would type in "<>roll 3d20"*

If you are only rolling a singular dice, you can just type <>roll d"int" where int is the number of sides

*Ex. If I want to roll a singular 23-sided die, I can type "<>roll 1d23" or "<>roll d23"*
